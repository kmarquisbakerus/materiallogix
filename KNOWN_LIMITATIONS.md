# MaterialLogix Release Limitations

The current public deployment is a product website and explicit browser demo,
not the finished paid cloud service. The authoritative, detailed release register
is maintained with the private application source.

Current public release blockers:

- account sessions, device activation, server-side licenses, checkout, prepaid
  balances, cloud authorization, and cloud workers are not deployed;
- production Studio access intentionally fails closed without `/api/session`;
- the Windows download is not yet a signed installer with a trusted updater;
- the custom domain certificate/DNS configuration is not production-ready;
- full local video engines and twelve finished house-voice models are incomplete;
- the demo is local browser software, with browser codec/storage constraints;
- analysis signals assist human review and do not guarantee creative, factual,
  legal, identity, anatomy, consent, or rights correctness.

Cloud charging and production account claims must remain unavailable until the
zero-trust backend and release acceptance tests are complete.
